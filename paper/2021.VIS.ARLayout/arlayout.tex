%% Abstract section.
\abstract{
The increasing popularity of VR/AR/MR devices has
attracted a great deal of attention from researchers in the communities of
virtual reality, visualization and human-computer interaction.
However, enabling the public to create AR-based visualizations
is challenging due to the steep learning curve of programming on AR devices.
In this paper, we propose \textit{ARLayout}, an authoring tool designed
for non-experts to build AR-based visual re-layouts towards massive physical targets,
such as books, coffees, drinking, foods, eyeshadows or even some toys,
which are captured from the reality world in real-time by the camera of
mobile devices such as mobile phones or tablets.
All the candidate targets can be segmented and labeled by
a convolutional neural network named BOWDA-Net~\cite{Zhu2020},
which just requires a small scale of labeled training 
samples (less than 100 for each case in our experiments).
The textual information is recognized by an OCR algorithm.
The visual re-layouts of the physical targets include highlighting
the search results by fisheye deformation, re-grouping and re-ranking.
Specifically, (1) the fuzzy keywords are input by voice to 
narrow down the number of candidate targets by searching,
while the search results will be highlighted in the AR environment 
to guide them where to find the targets in the reality world.
%, e.g., searching books with fuzzy keywords from massive books in a library.
(2) candidate targets can be re-grouped in the AR environment according to one/multiple of 
their nominal, ordinal or quantitative attributes.
(3) candidate targets can be re-ranked in the AR environment according to one of
their ordinal or quantitative attributes.
We demonstrate the usability, expressiveness and effectiveness 
of \textit{ARLayout} by user study and case study with three usage scenarios in the evaluation.
